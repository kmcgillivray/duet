# Duet

A social network for two people. Sometimes we want to share things with just one of our friends, but it can be hard to keep track of conversations about the things we share. Articles, pictures, and fleeting conversations get lost in text messages or emails. Duet is a shared feed for just two people. Invite a friend, share links, photos, and moments, and connect even more with the people you care about most.
